////spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/shopping

This line in the application.properties file of a Java Spring project is configuring the datasource URL for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. Let's break it down:

spring.datasource.url: This is a configuration property used by Spring Boot to specify the URL needed to connect to the database.
jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/shopping: This part specifies the JDBC URL used to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Breaking it down further:
jdbc:postgresql://: This is the JDBC URL prefix for PostgreSQL databases.
db: This is the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server. In this case, it's specified as just db, which implies that there's likely another configuration that resolves db to the actual hostname or IP address. This could be done through Docker networking, Kubernetes services, or a hosts file entry.
5432: This is the default port number for PostgreSQL databases. It's the port where the PostgreSQL server is listening for incoming connections.
shopping: This is the name of the database that the application wants to connect to. In this case, it's named shopping.

-p 5434:5432 (5434 we assigning this port to dbeaver and 5432 is default port where postgres is running.
we are exposing port 5434 because on port 5432 dbeaver is alread running in any case.
we are port mapping from 5432 to 5434 port so that we can use in local machine.)
