1. The "docker exec" command allows you to run commands inside an existing container. For example, docker exec
     -it container_id /bin/bash would open a bash shell inside the container with ID container_id.

 2. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose,
    you define the services, networks, and volumes in a single docker-compose.yml file and then use docker-compose

    and managing containers.

4. The "docker login" command allows users to log into Docker Hub or any other Docker registry from the command-line interface.

5. The default bridge network in Docker allows containers to communicate with each other on the same host machine,
    but it does not allow for direct external access.

6. Docker supports several network types, including bridge, host, and overlay. "transit" is not one of the built-in
    network types in Docker.

7. The "docker logs container_name" command allows you to view the logs of a running container.

8. The "docker volume create" command is used to create a new volume.
9. The "docker stop container_name" command stops a running container.
10. Volumes allow you to connect specified filesystem paths of the container back to the host computer.
